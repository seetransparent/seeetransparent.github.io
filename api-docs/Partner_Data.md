# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for the Transparent Partner API. 

This page is under construction, please expect more details on the API very soon.

# Key Principles

Our partner data API relied on millions of anonimyzed reservations collected through our network of partners. This database has been built over the last 4 years, and allows to get clear visibility through demand trends and gain insights on length of stay, booking window, demand by OTA and more. 

Our API offers 3 endpoints, aiming at making this data available in aggregate form to TransparentÂ´s clients and partners.

For more information, feel free to reach out to our team at hi@seetransparent.com
